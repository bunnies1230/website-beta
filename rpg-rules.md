# RPG Rules

Though those playing on the RPG server are already server members who have read and agreed to our rules, RPG has a handful of specific rules as well as clarifications and changes to the general server rules.

## RPG Server Rules

- **Rule 1** - All standard damNation rules apply unless otherwise stated.

- **Rule 2** - **(Clarification on Server Rule 4)** - DO NOT abuse glitches - RPG is a largely custom coded server, so there are bound to be errors every now and then. If something seems broken or seems to work incorrectly, make a modreq as soon as you can. Abusing a glitch without notifying staff will be treated as cheating and may result in disciplinary action.

      Hacked clients, using cheats, taking advantage of glitches will land you in trouble.

- **Rule 3a** - **(Clarification on Server Rule 4)** - Griefing is not allowed - Destruction of builds is explicitly prohibited. The *only* instance where breaking blocks in another player's build is allowed is to create a 2x1 hole big enough to enter an otherwise closed-off structure.

- **Rule 3b** - Looting is allowed - If a chest or furnace or other storage block is unprotected, it can be looted. Remember to protect your items.

- **Rule 4** - **(Clarification on Server Rule 13)** - DO NOT build Mob Farms, XP Grinders, and any other type of mob grinder. You will not be banned for their use, but if caught, you'll invoke the wrath of the DM, typically resulting in the destruction of your grinder among other potential RP penalties.

- **Rule 5** - **(Clarification on Server Rule 8)** - You DO NOT need to be 128 blocks away to build. You are free to build wherever you can, but remember that any building solely meant to irritate another player is not permitted. This is including but not limited to building walls/moats or placing lava/water around an opponents' protected chunks.

- **Rule 6a** - DO NOT claim chunks clearly containing another player's build. 
- **Rule 6b** - DO NOT intentionally build a structure near another kingdom with the intent to antagonize without reason. However, if you have discussed doing so with the leader.
- 
- **Rule 7** - DO NOT Combat Log - this includes logging out or switching servers while in combat with another player. Such unsportsmanlike actions may result in removal of right to play on RPG.

- **Rule 8** - DO NOT spawn camp - we have anti-camping measures in place to protect people after respawning.

      You are expected to uphold the spirit and the letter of the rules on all our servers.
