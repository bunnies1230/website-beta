# RPG Rules

Though those playing on the RPG server are already server members who have read and agreed to our rules, RPG has a handful of specific rules as well as clarifications and changes to the general server rules.

## RPG Server Rules

- **Rule 1** - You must be able to act maturely. We no longer require applicants to be <span style="color: red;">**18+**</span>
<p style="border: 5px solid #77df88; text-align:center;border-radius:10px;background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;margin: 0px 50px 20px 50px;">
      <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/membership-age">Read more</a> about our Membership Age Policy
</p>
- **Rule 2** - Be courteous and respect others. Agree to disagree.

- **Rule 3** - If you would not like somebody doing to you, what you are thinking of doing to them, DO NOT do it. We're talking common, real world, sense here, folks.

<p style="border: 5px solid #77df88; text-align:center;border-radius:10px;background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;margin: 0px 50px 20px 50px;">
      Hacked clients, using cheats, taking advantage of glitches will land you in trouble.
</p>

- **Rule 4** - No exploits, duping, cheating, stealing, griefing, hacking, modded clients etc. We do allow some Client mods. Find out more by scrolling below.

      We have particular build requirements which you should pay close attention to.
</p>

- **Rule 5** - Gather resources, but leave the landscape looking natural and beautiful, please.

- **Rule 6** - No giant 2d builds outside of creative worlds. The only place you can build giant pixelart, voxelart, flags etc is creative.

- **Rule 7** - Put effort in to all your builds, build with taste.

- **Rule 8** - Build beyond <span style="color: red;">**128**</span> blocks from your neighbor.

- **Rule 9** - Redstone contraptions must not impinge on server performance.

- **Rule 10** - If your conduct results in receiving instructions from a staff member (dark red, red, and pink names), always obey.

- **Rule 11** - No chat spam or flooding, no caps spam, no commercials for other servers or any commercial services. No excessive swearing and no swearing at other players.

- **Rule 12** - Report misbehaviour, grief, exploits and bugs to staff using the forum, pm's, or mumble. Do no bother them unnecessarily, and NEVER EVER bother staff for op or admin rights.

- **Rule 13** - Mobtowers/XPgrinders etc are allowed in MODERATION. In relation to both XP and Items: No collection of items/xp while afk; no unattended automation of item/xp gathering, including mcmmo experience; and absolutely no unattended macroing. With an off-switch, and do not build in heavily populated areas. You are not allowed to let any mob stack up more than about 100 in a chunk, you should add a way to quickly kill mobs if they do stack up. (excessive stacking of monsters is cause for warning/demotion/ban!). Furthermore, towers must be covered and look like actual builds (not like flying platforms) - follow the building rules and some aesthetics please. No one wants to see giant cobble/wood cubes in the landscape.

- **Rule 14** - No commercials for other servers or any commercial services.

- **Rule 15** - On your registration to enter the server: Take the bold red number from Rule 1 on this rule overview page and ADD it to the bold red number from Rule #8 on this page, above, look.... it sticks out like a sore thumb, do you see it? Ahh good, you got it. Now write the total (aka sum) when asked. Thank you for understanding we only do this to make sure people read the rules' overview properly. It's an amazingly effective mechanism, and you'll love the result of it once you join our community. You'd be amazed how many people just skim read, particularly younger people. Thanks for your understanding in keeping this such an awesome server.

      You are expected to uphold the spirit and the letter of the rules on all our servers.
