# RPG Rules

Though those playing on the RPG server are already server members who have read and agreed to our rules, RPG has a handful of specific rules as well as clarifications and changes to the general server rules. Any rules that are added mid-round will be added with a date after the entry.

- **Rule 1** - All standard damNation rules apply unless otherwise stated.

- **Rule 2** - **(Clarification on Server Rule 4)** - No Abusing Glitches - RPG is a largely custom coded server, so there are bound to be errors every now and then. If something seems broken or seems to work incorrectly, make a modreq as soon as you can. Abusing a glitch without notifying staff will be treated as cheating and may result in disciplinary action.

      Hacked clients, using cheats, taking advantage of glitches will land you in trouble.

- **Rule 3a** - **(Clarification on Server Rule 4)** - No Griefing - Destruction of builds is explicitly prohibited. The *only* instance where breaking blocks in another player's build is allowed is to create a 2x1 hole big enough to enter an otherwise closed-off structure.
- **Rule 3b** - Looting is allowed - If a chest or furnace or other storage block is unprotected, it can be looted. Remember to protect your items.

- **Rule 4** - **(Clarification on Server Rule 13)** - No building Mob Farms, XP Grinders, and any other type of mob/item/xp grinder - You will not be banned for their use, but if caught, you'll invoke the wrath of the DM, typically resulting in the destruction of your grinder among other potential RP penalties.

- **Rule 5** - **(Clarification on Server Rule 8)** - You do not need to be 128 blocks away to build - You are free to build wherever you can, but remember that any building solely meant to irritate another player is not permitted. This is including but not limited to building walls/moats or placing lava/water around an opponents' protected chunks.

- **Rule 6a** - No claiming chunks clearly containing another player's build. 
- **Rule 6b** - No intentionally building a structure near another kingdom with the intent to antagonize without reason - However, if you have discussed doing so with the leader and it becomes a part of your roleplay, this is alright.
- 
- **Rule 7** - No Combat Logging - this includes logging out or switching servers while in combat with another player. Such unsportsmanlike actions may result in removal of right to play on RPG.

- **Rule 8** - No Spawn Camping - we have anti-camping measures in place to protect people after respawning.

      Playing on RPG means you have read and agreed to the above rules.<br/>Any rulebreak that is met with the excuse of "I didn't read the rules" will not be accepted.
