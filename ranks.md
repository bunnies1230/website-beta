# Ranks

Apprentice and Journeyman are ranks that are part of your membership to the servers in NetherEndingStory. Do not nag admins about being ranked up, doing so will only lower your chances of getting it. Our ranks are a privilege and not a right. We keep track of players commitment to the server, playing time, voting, builds, helpfulness and general behavior and we'll contact you when we think you are ready.

* Ranks are determined by a few **objective stat-based categories** from the statistics we've collected on main from over the years. The numbers and categories behind this system will not be released for now, but safe to say, they are some of the most **fundamental statistics** gained while playing on damNation.
* At any rank, donors will be signified with a [#] tag before their name. Being a donor will not grant you access to any new ranks.
* All new members start out as Goblins, and as they play more on main, their rank will increase. 
* **The increase in ranks is not automatic**. Though staff will pay attention to those who may be on the borderline, asking staff a friendly "I am eligible for another rank?" every so often is **perfectly acceptable**! You may even get a new rank out of it.
* Grim functions the same as Architect does now - exceptional members who have devoted a lot of time and energy to make the server a better community. This rank is only accessible to those nominated by staff and serves only one benefit above the Chimera rank - access to donor perks. **All current Architects will be moved to this rank**.
* Perks that were previously reserved for donors or other ranks have now been recalculated to be progression-based upgrades (like having more homes per world or /upp) or have been added to a player rank as a one-off perk (using TNT or World Edit). See the spoiler below for details!

## Staff
Unlike some servers, becoming staff on damNation should never be an expectation, but rather a privilege that comes with many responsibilities and high levels of trust. Our entirely volunteer staff work long and hard to keep damnNation the best it can be so all can enjoy its community and features. However, you can do your part by error-reporting and giving other feedback that help us make sure we are running the kind of server we can all enjoy. If you'd like to know more about our staff members, talk to them in game or visit their Staff Biography Pages.

## Non Members

### Jackalope
<span style="color: #4c4c4c;">**Dark Gray**</span> - Regular visitors of the server who are not approved members may be promoted to a subset of the peon rank that is a darker gray. This rank adds no new permissions and only acts to distinguish those who are regular tourists. 

### Imp
<span style="color: #999999;">**Light Gray**</span> - The guest rank cant build or destroy, only look, chat, move around and go through portals. A "tourist" so to speak. While as a tourist, players can still play on the Minigames server. A subset of this rank is Ghost - which is the punishment rank for miscreants. Ghosts can only look and move, not even chat.
