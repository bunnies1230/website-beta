## Step 1: Read and Accept Server Rules 
Read the [Rules and Policies](../rules.md "Rules and Policies"). The rules are very important to us. We are looking for players who want to be part of a grown-up minecraft community. Although age is no guarantee of maturity, players of 18+ years have already had (at least) some (if not lots of) life experience, and will understand that a community needs some sort of structure in order to maintain its existence. Our community has grown and developed, since 2011. Sections of our minecraft community have been playing minecraft together for almost three years, so we've been around. Our rules are important to us to help define, protect, shape and guide our community. Don't take them lightly.

## Step 3: Complete the Server Membership Application

Fill out our [Member Application](https://damnation.eu/phpbb/application.php) Form.

When you submit it, your application will automatically be posted to the [New Members forum](https://damnation.eu/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=21) for staff members to review. Applications can typically take an hour to a day for a staff member to review it. <b>Be sure to check back every so often after the application to check its status!</b>

A staff member may have more questions for you or may wish to speak to you in-game to get to know you before they accept you. If this is the case, they will reply that in your thread.

<b>If you are accepted</b>, a staff member will move your application to the [Accepted Members forum](https://damnation.eu/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=24) and promote you in-game. 

<b>If you are denied</b>, your application will be moved to the [Denied Membership forum](https://damnation.eu/phpbb/viewforum.php?f=25) with an explanation of why you were denied. If you feel you were wrongly denied, reply to your thread or PM an admin. If your appeal fails, you are free to apply again after a few months.
