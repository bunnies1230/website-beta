##Distinguishing Features
</div>
<p>Ocean. Mostly just ocean. There are a few islands but the focus here is ocean. Specifically for the purpose of ocean monuments. There are a few of those as well. This world resets - do not build anything here because it will be lost upon reset. Resets are either staff-triggered or can be done by any player when you feel the monuments have been fully looted.</p>

##Points of Interest
</div>
<p>Really the only interest here is the monuments. There are three in the world that can be found by travelling around by boat.</p>
