##History
</div>
<p>Earthsea was launched in December 2014. It was intended as a world where Ocean Monuments (introduced in Minecraft 1.8) could be harvested for materials. It is a resettable world, so that the structures in the world can be raided over and over again. </p>

##Distinguishing Features
</div>
<p>Earthsea is entirely composed of Ocean biome, with scattered islands here and there. The oceans are home to several Ocean Monuments, which are protected by Guardians. Because this world can be reset at will, it gives a never-ending supply of materials such as prismarine and sea lanterns, which can only be collected by defeating Guardians and raiding Ocean Monuments.</p>

<p>This world does not have any warps or other landmarks.</p>

<p>This world gets its name from the fantasy series by Ursula K. Le Guin which takes place in a world called Earthsea.</p>
