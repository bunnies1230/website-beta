##History
</div>
<p>Glorantha was launched December 2014. It is a 1.8 V-Custom world, which means it was generated using Minecraft's vanilla world generator, but using custom generation settings for some unique features. The world's spawn was built by Mijeman as a part of a competition specifically to design a spawn for the world.</p>

##Distinguishing Features
</div>
<p>Glorantha's v-custom settings give the world unique terrain features. Along with wide open fields, dense forests, and magnificent mountains, the world also features no ore-level restrictions. This means ores can be mined at any height.</p>
<p>Glorantha also features an in-progress rail-and-road transportation system that aims to connect builds across the world for easy access. </p>
