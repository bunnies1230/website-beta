##Distinguishing Features
</div>

<p>5 distinct areas distinguish this small world from the rest. There are large forest, clay, snow, mountain and volcanic areas. There are a few player builds here.</p>

<p>The underground structure is not typical. There are seemingly random caves scattered throughout the underworld. Lots of ores surface in these caves. The caves are not connected so prepare to do some digging!</p>
