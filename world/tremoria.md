##Distinguishing Features

<p>Tremoria's most distinguishing feature is its amplified terrain. This makes Tremoria challenging to travel in, but gives it very scenic landscapes. It has an expansive mesa biome, as well as deserts and grasslands. </p>

##Points of Interest
</div>
<p>Tremoria's terrain makes direct travel difficult, but there is an ongoing project to connect player builds with roads and trails. The northwestern quadrant has the most developed trail system so far, connecting spawn to builds by fat_leeloo, liminalmask, minithra, pooligan, mutant_anthrax, and ickkle. </p>
