#Getting Around

Starting out in a new server can be quite daunting. damNation has a LOT to see and do, way more than your average server. This page lists some indispensable travel tips for getting around in the multiverse. You'll still feel a bit lost, but hey, that's part of the fun of being on a new server, right!

##Local Travel
</div>
The most personalized method of travel is using homes. When you start out, you can only have <b>one /home per world</b> which you can set with <b>/sethome</b> or an optional name with <b>/sethome (homename)</b>. We recommend you set this home at your Spawn City plot in [Homeland]({{site.baseurl}}/homeland). Once you gain higher ranks, you can set more homes per world! Extra homes <b>must</b> be set with a name. Homes are <b>case-sensitive</b> - <i>there is a difference between /home Storage and /home storage</i>. List your homes with <b>/homes</b>.

      PROTIP: If you use unique home titles in each world, you can travel quickly between homes in different worlds!

##World Maps
</div>

Use our excellent Dynmap to see where you are and where you might want to go in any world. <b>Read more - [Dynmaps]({{site.baseurl}}/dynmaps)

By default, main's dynmap will show you Homeland. You can scroll down the world bar on the right panel or click your character's name to switch location or world to where you currently are. Zoom in and out with the scroll wheel or the +/- buttons in the top left.

##City Travel
</div>
Imps walk, but goblins know how to get around efficiently.

List all warps in any given world with <b>/warps list</b>. Homeland has by far the most warps of any world, so it has its own warp menu accessible by typing <b>/warps</b>.

##Travel to Other Worlds
</div>
damNation has a vibrant multiverse featuring worlds like the Nether, The End, Rainforest, Panau, Hammerfell, and Glorantha. Check out over a dozen more worlds by typing <b>/warp nexus</b> from <b>any world</b> and exploring the floors of portals below!

<p style="border: 5px solid #77df88; text-align:center;border-radius:10px;background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;margin: 0px 50px 20px 50px;">
      ADVANCED TIP: You can use warps from other worlds! The command <b>/warp spawn</b> will bring you to your current world's spawn, however, <b>/warp homeland spawn</b> will go to Homeland's! Replace 'homeland' with any world and 'spawn' with any of that world's warps and you'll be warping around the server like a professional!

##Travel to Other Players
</div>
You can request a teleport to another player using <b>/tpa [player]</b>. The player then must type <b>/tpaccept</b> to accept your request. You can also request other players to teleport to you via <b>/tpahere [player]</b>. This usually works across servers, however we advise you to be on the same server as the player who you want to teleport to. You cannot use this feature in worlds where teleporting is not permitted due to unfair advantages.
