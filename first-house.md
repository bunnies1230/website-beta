#Building Code
</div>
You are free to build in whatever style you wish, but keep in mind damNation's building code:
<b>Plot Dimensions</b>
Starter plots are 20x20, extending up 20 blocks and down to bedrock. You may [expand your plot higher]({{site.baseurl}}/land) for a fee.

<b>Automatic Protection</b>
Your plot is fully protected - no one else can build, destroy, or take anything from chests. However, players are free to open doors, press buttons, or trigger pressure plates and tripwires. You may lock things like doors by using <b>/lock</b> or add players to your chests with <b>/cmodify</b> (Read More - [LWC Guide]({{site.baseurl/g/lwc)). You may add other players to your plot with <b>/rg addmember (plotname) (player)</b> (Read More - [WorldGuard Guide]({{site.baseurl/g/worldguard)).

<b>Keep Up Appearances</b>
One of the rules that you agreed to when joining the server dealt with the restriction of "cobble box" type builds. We ask that you consider the builds around you and make something as, if not more, attractive. If you don't think you can build well, <b>ask other players or admins for tips</b> or to tour their builds for inspiration!

<b>Reposession</b>
You have <b>10 days</b> to complete your build. This includes interior and exterior above ground. Your basement is not included. Once you have completed your house, it will be safe from repossession. Staff will put a sign outside your plot to give you at least a week's notice before the plot is reset. Any valuable items inside of the plot are saved, so you may claim them again at any time by visiting it yourself at <b>/warp homeland vault</b> and then asking an admin to <b>check the vault</b> and retrieve your items.

#Home Is Where The /sethome Is
</div>
New residents join the server and build their home every day, and the City is getting bigger! To avoid getting lost in the unfamiliar streets, the first thing you should do is set your home by typing <b>/sethome (homename)</b>. Revisit your home by typing <b>/home (homename)</b>

#The Bottom Line
</div>

Build your first home, set up your underground base or go on an adventure - it is up to you! Just remember you have up to ten days to do something with the plot.

Conversely, if you donâ€™t make good progress in ten days, you may be considered as having lost interest in the server. Your plot may be taken back to the State and given to someone else, so you'd have to start again if you didn't manage to complete your build before returning to the server after a period of absence.

Once you have a build ready AND a minimum of 1 week has passed since you first signed up AND you have been promoted to at least the next rank, your build is safe from the State. It will NEVER be repossessed and because [damNation's charter]({{site.baseurl}}/server-charter) means your work is safe with us, even if the server has to do something with the map, you'll always be able to download the map file and marvel at your first (and hopefully not your final) build in the world.
