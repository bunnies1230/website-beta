#RPG Gameplay
</div>

<hr>
<p>The server has been constructed with a variety of RPG features like kingdoms, classes, jobs, bosses, building, rare items, and exploration. Though we've tried to keep the gameplay simple, to ensure you get the most out of your experience, there are some features that you should know more about before diving into the server.</p>

##Pre-Round
</div>

<p>For a new round to start, <b>FOUR</b> new leaders must volunteer themselves to head the new kingdoms. The first round of eligible players must be <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/ranks">Hydra or above</a> and are first-come first-serve on the announcement post. If 4 eligible players have not volunteered, the requirement will decrease one rank each day, with a minimum rank of <b>Siren</b>. </p>

<p>Once an eligible player is queued up to be a leader, they can elect one advisor to start with them. These will be the founders of the kingdom and get to determine the initial roleplay direction of the kingdom. The founders will be able to <b>build their own starter castle</b> in a 32x32 creative plot. The castle can be built in any style, so long as solely wood and stone variants are used. All builds will be wiped of chests, furnaces, ores, and other valuable blocks before placement. The week before the start of the round, the castle will be placed in the world and those 4 chunks will be claimed for free.</p>

##Citizens
</div>

<p>There are four functional positions on the server - <b>Leader</b>, <b>Advisor</b>, <b>Citizen</b>, and <b>Peasant</b>. Below are a list of features that each position has access to. Each higher position inherits the features of the previous position.</p>

<p>The initial founder is the first leader. There can only be one leader at a time and every kingdom always must have a leader. If a  leader wants to step down, they must promote an advisor to take their place, which will cause the two players to switch positions. The new leader will inherit ownership of all claimed chunks.</p>

<p>Outside of the positions, leaders can grant cosmetic titles to any citizen of their empire including themself. This allows leaders to create internal hierarchies, specializations, and honorary titles to diversify their kingdom.</p>

##Governments
</div>

<p>Different forms of governments determine the basis of leadership changes and internal economy. Don't worry, there's no math required here, on your end. The leadership changes are used in the event that a leader is inactive, steps down, or the natural election cycle has come around. Internal economy information deals with how your money is used when you deposit it into your treasury. Depending on the government, a certain percentage of your deposit will be deposited, given to the leader, redistributed to your fellow citizens, or even wasted. Reference the chart below for information about government difference.</p>
