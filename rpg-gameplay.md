#RPG Gameplay
</div>

<hr>
<p>The server has been constructed with a variety of RPG features like kingdoms, classes, jobs, bosses, building, rare items, and exploration. Though we've tried to keep the gameplay simple, to ensure you get the most out of your experience, there are some features that you should know more about before diving into the server.</p>

##Pre-Round
</div>

<p>For a new round to start, <b>FOUR</b> new leaders must volunteer themselves to head the new kingdoms. The first round of eligible players must be <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/ranks">Hydra or above</a> and are first-come first-serve on the announcement post. If 4 eligible players have not volunteered, the requirement will decrease one rank each day, with a minimum rank of <b>Siren</b>. </p>

<p>Once an eligible player is queued up to be a leader, they can elect one advisor to start with them. These will be the founders of the kingdom and get to determine the initial roleplay direction of the kingdom. The founders will be able to build their own starter castle in a 32x32 creative plot. The castle can be built in any style, so long as solely wood and stone variants are used. All builds will be wiped of chests, furnaces, ores, and other valuable blocks before placement. The week before the start of the round, the castle will be placed in the world and those 4 chunks will be claimed for free.</p>
