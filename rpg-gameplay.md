#RPG Gameplay
</div>

<hr>
<p>The server has been constructed with a variety of RPG features like kingdoms, classes, jobs, bosses, building, rare items, and exploration. Though we've tried to keep the gameplay simple, to ensure you get the most out of your experience, there are some features that you should know more about before diving into the server.</p>

<hr>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Pre-Round
</div>

<p>For a new round to start, <b>FOUR</b> new leaders must volunteer themselves to head the new kingdoms. The first round of eligible players must be <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/ranks">Hydra or above</a> and are first-come first-serve on the announcement post. If 4 eligible players have not volunteered, the requirement will decrease one rank each day, with a minimum rank of <b>Siren</b>. </p>

<p>Once an eligible player is queued up to be a leader, they can elect one advisor to start with them. These will be the founders of the kingdom and get to determine the initial roleplay direction of the kingdom. The founders will be able to <b>build their own starter castle</b> in a 32x32 creative plot. The castle can be built in any style, so long as solely wood and stone variants are used. All builds will be wiped of chests, furnaces, ores, and other valuable blocks before placement. The week before the start of the round, the castle will be placed in the world and those 4 chunks will be claimed for free.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Getting Started
</div>

<p>When you first join, you'll be greeted by the message welcome you to the server and explaining the server's purpose. In each of the four directions are displays for each of the four kingdoms. Right clicking the <b>red bar</b> below each display shows you basic information about that kingdom. To join a kingdom, simply type <b>/kingdom join [kingdom name]</b> and you will be added! With your starting balance, you can teleport to your kingdom's home directly with <b>/home</b> or you can find its location on the <a href="https://damnation.eu/rpgmap"><b>dynmap</b></a> and run there.</p>

<p><b>Once you're in a kingdom, the fun begins!</b> Communicate with your fellow citizens and leaders to find or make your place in the kingdom. Join a job through <b>/jobs browse</b> (<i>Read more about jobs below</i>) and gear up like normal! Before you go venturing out, though, be sure you take note of all of the information below!</p>

<hr>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Citizens
</div>

<p>There are four functional positions on the server - <b>Leader</b>, <b>Advisor</b>, <b>Citizen</b>, and <b>Peasant</b>. Below are a list of features that each position has access to. Each higher position inherits the features of the previous position.</p>

<p>The initial founder is the first leader. There can only be one leader at a time and every kingdom always must have a leader. If a  leader wants to step down, they must promote an advisor to take their place, which will cause the two players to switch positions. The new leader will inherit ownership of all claimed chunks.</p>

<p>Outside of the positions, leaders can grant cosmetic titles to any citizen of their empire including themself. This allows leaders to create internal hierarchies, specializations, and honorary titles to diversify their kingdom.</p>
<hr>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Governments
</div>

<p>Different forms of governments determine the basis of leadership changes and internal economy. Don't worry, there's no math required here, on your end. The leadership changes are used in the event that a leader is inactive, steps down, or the natural election cycle has come around. Internal economy information deals with how your money is used when you deposit it into your treasury. Depending on the government, a certain percentage of your deposit will be deposited, given to the leader, redistributed to your fellow citizens, or even wasted. Reference the chart below for information about government difference.</p>

<hr>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Economy
</div>

<p>On the RPG server, the economy is completely separate from our main economy of Crowns. Here, the sought after currency is <b>Rupees</b>. Money is earned primarily through performing actions through your jobs. Money should primarily be spent on depositing into your kingdom's treasury, but it can also be used for travel expenses, buying materials or labor, or access to certain areas of the world. The commands remain the same as on main, which can be found in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/economy">Fe Guide</a></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Jobs
</div>
<p>The primary method of earning money is to join a job. <b>A player <i>DOES NOT</i> need be a part of a kingdom to join a job</b>. Jobs have been organized into six primary classes - <b>Vampire</b>, <b>Werewolf</b>, <b>Orc</b>, <b>Dwarf</b>, <b>Wizard</b>, and <b>Hobbit</b>. Drawing from the lore of these races in classical fantasy, each class has different major and minor skills. As you perform actions your class is skilled in, you will gain experience and rank up, earning progressively more rewards for the same jobs. Major skills earn a class the maximum amount of money and experience. Minor skills earn a smaller percentage of the maximum money and experience. <b>Every class can do every gameplay action</b>. However, the actions that are not included as a skill will gain even less money than a minor skill and no experience toward your class.</p>
<p>Players can only be a worker in one job at a time. You may switch at any time, however, you will lose 10% (rounded up) of your gained levels upon leaving - at level 23, leaving a job will lose 3 levels. The maximum level for every job is 50. Once this maximum level is attained, you are free to switch to any other class without level loss in <b>that job only</b>. Leaving another job that is not at the max level will still result in level loss.</p>

<p>Below are the general skills for each class. To view specific information about which actions earn how much money and experience, look at the GUI accessed through <b>/jobs browse</b>.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Items
</div>
<p>Several new items have been introduced to the game as rare drops from boss monsters. <i>More information to come...</i></p>
<hr>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Land Ownership
</div>

<p>Kingdoms begin with a maximum of <b>16 chunks</b> that can be claimed. For every citizen that joins outside of the original founders, the kingdom can claim 4 more chunks. Only Leaders can claim and unclaim chunks. Claiming a chunk is a <b>50 Rupee investment</b> that can be returned if the chunk is later unclaimed. Chunks can only be claimed <b>within 128 blocks</b> of the kingdom's current /home location. This home location can be changed by Leaders or Advisors at a hefty cost of <b>1000 Rupees</b> if further expansion is wanted.</p>

<p>Every chunk claimed is owned by the current leader and all members of the kingdom are added as members. If a new leader is promoted, they will inherit ownership of the kingdom's land. Monster spawning is denied. Chests are protected automatically upon placement like on Main. For chest management, consult our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/g/lwc">LWC Guide</a>. All protected chunks are visible on the dynmap.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Building
</div>
<p>Building is <b>aesthetic</b>, <b>manual</b>, and <b>optional</b>. There are no auto-generated or auto-building structures. We recommend building walls to keep out enemy players and monsters, but there are no real functional buildings to create. How you decide to build up your kingdom is entirely up to the kingdom's citizens.</p>

<hr>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##World
</div>

<p>The world is a custom RPG world build by Lemon-Fox. The world was chosen for its variety of biomes, breathtaking custom trees, altered cave generation, and non-vanilla terrain generation. Players can build anywhere in the wilderness. Only spawn, dungeons/other points of interest, and kingdom chunks are protected from building. Scope out the environment, scout your enemy's locations, and check out kingdom locations and land claims on the <a href="https://damnation.eu/rpgmap"><b>RPG Server Dynmap</b></a></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Travel
</div>
<p>Typical methods of travel from Main have been disabled, including /tpa, /spawn, /sethome, and /back. The primary method of travel is by foot, by boat, by cart, or by horse. Members of kingdoms have access to /home, which for the cost of <b>100 Rupees</b> will teleport you directly to your kingdom's set spawnpoint.</p>

<p>Points of interest around the world feature warps, however, you must travel and visit them once in order to warp there. <i>More information to come...</i></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Enemies
</div>
<p>Boss monsters will higher health, special abilities, and valuable drops have a change of spawning throughout the map. Others only spawn in specific areas. Normal monsters have higher health than their vanilla counterparts. <i>More information to come...</i></p>
