# Server Charter

### Your Work is SAFE Here!


We will NEVER EVER do a map-wipe on a world that has seen serious attention from players, without it being absolutely necessary. In that case, maps will be shared via this website; on the forum; torrent; or other means. Nethers, and Ends and other more transient maps may be wiped - but in that case you will know about it well in advance.

The servers are intended for grown-up and mature people to enjoy MineCraft together and build a community around it. There will be no tolerance for PvE griefing or anti-social behaviour (and that includes PvP games on our adventure servers), the PvE server is set up with that in mind - from sign-up and server ranks - to how plugins, permissions and world protections are implemented. The staff have access to powerful anti-griefing and rollback measures and we can look up anything ever done on the server. Every single block placed or removed, and all interactions with chests. Remember that if you ever are asked about what you did or what happened by a mod or admin. We can see it all.

Griefing and stealing will be dealt with switfly and efficiently. We also implement certain global banning solutions, so bans done elsewhere may be counted here and vice-versa. Remember that before you are tempted to do stupid things.

We back-up, and we know how to restore if and when called upon to do so. Our worlds should be quite safe. If we can help it, no major work will ever be lost.

Certainly, I cannot make guarantees. But I promise to you, all faithful DamNation players, I will do my very best to make sure your hard and proper work is never lost. If/when the server retires, fails permanently or breaks, all worlds etc will be made available to the members somehow. At least the latest available and functioning backup.
