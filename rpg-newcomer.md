##Getting Started on RPG
</div>

<p>When you first join, you'll be greeted by the message welcome you to the server and explaining the server's purpose. In each of the four directions are displays for each of the four kingdoms. Right clicking the <b>red bar</b> below each display shows you basic information about that kingdom. To join a kingdom, simply type <b>/kingdom join [kingdom name]</b> and you will be added!</p>

<p style="border: 5px solid #77df88; text-align:center;border-radius:10px;background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;margin: 0px 70px 20px 70px;">
<b>NOTE: To counteract kingdom imbalance, players cannot join a kingdom that already has two more members than the kingdom with the lowest population. Example: You cannot join Kingdom 1 with 6 members if Kingdom 4 only has 4</b>
</p>

<p>With your starting balance, you can teleport to your kingdom's home directly with <b>/home</b> or you can find its location on the <a href="https://damnation.eu/rpgmap"><b>dynmap</b></a> and run there.</p>

<p style="border: 5px solid #77df88; text-align:center;border-radius:10px;background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;margin: 0px 70px 20px 70px;">
<b>IMPORTANT: You cannot leave a kingdom manually after joining. However, if you ever wish to leave a kingdom, please notify your leader and a staff member so that you can be removed from the kingdom.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Once you're in a kingdom, the fun begins!</b> Communicate with your fellow citizens and leaders to find or make your place in the kingdom. Join a job through <b>/jobs browse</b> (<i>Read more about jobs below</i>) and gear up like normal! Before you go venturing out, though, be sure you take note of all of the information below!</p>

##Early Round
</div>

<p>At the beginning of each round, player will be able to join kingdoms at will as citizens. The first members will be able to choose a 2x2 chunk starting location that will be protected. In this first week, players can explore the world, gather materials, and build up their castle from scratch. Once this week is up, a leader will be selected.</p>

<p style="border: 5px solid #77df88; text-align:center;border-radius:10px;background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;margin: 0px 70px 20px 70px;">
<b>NOTE: Any player of any rank can play on the server as a normal citizen. Once the round begins and leaders are chosen, ANY player can become a leader.</b>
</p>

<p>Since the first kingdom government is Feudalism, a leader will be selected in each kingdom based on that government's leader selection process - trial by combat. The members of the kingdom will be placed in a bracket pitting them in matches against their fellow kingdom citizens. These fights will take place in the gladiator arena on our Minigames server. Once a leader is crowned, they will be able to select advisors and begin their leader duties like using treasury money and managing land claims.</p>
