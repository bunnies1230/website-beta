# Welcome to damNation, novice Goblin!

This guide is a short step-by-step introduction how to get started on damNation and how to access our features and benefits to get the most out of your stay and experience here.

Once you made a successful application, an admin will promotion to Goblin. Goblin (light green color) is a "probational" rank when you are new. You can play normally, but with just a few small limitations - mainly meant to avoid issues with grief. Once you have played for 1-2 weeks without issue, been on a minimum of 10 hours and finished your first build (normally a Spawn City house), you may ask for a promotion to Journeyman, which is our normal "full member" status. Higher ranks are attainable, but only through doing serious megabuilds or donating to the server. Journeyman full member really is an uncrippled full membership status and you can do everything normally.

Enough of that, you'll learn it all later. As a new-born Apprentice you'll probably want to do the following right away:

## How to Start out

1.  Get the free starter-kit in the information house near spawn. Do /spawn to get there fast. It has some basics and some food so you won't starve.
2.  Vote for the server! This will get you some nice and easy cash to get started. You can vote daily on each site, earning you 200c per day. Check your money with /money.
3.  Get an overview of the city and the different worlds on our server. Use [our excellent dynmap](https://damnation.eu/dynmap/) to see where you are and where you can go. Homeland is the main starting world, home to our Spawn City. Find out more about [The Multiverse of damNation.eu](http://www.netherendingstory.com/main/getting-started/multiverse-worlds). If you want to go to wilderness, homeland is currently very full - so choose another newer or custom world.
4.  Understand [how to get around in the city](/main/getting-started/getting-around) (besides walking). List all warps with /warps list, then go to for instance /warp alleytown (which is the area most likely to have free plots).
5.  Look around the city for a FREE plot. Available plots have signs on them that says "For Sale", new players may buy ONE plot in Spawn City. Later on, you may buy plots in the wilderness for a fee. While looking at the dynmap, plots with green borders are open and free for purchase.
  * Buy the plot by right clicking on the sign and follow instructions.
  * Starting plots are usually 20x20 blocks and you may build 20 high and dig as deep as you want (bedrock). Wan't higher? Buy some extra height with crowns.
  * Your plot is fully protected - no one else can build, destroy or take stuff from chests on it (they can open wood doors and use buttons though).

7.  Set your home by typing /sethome (costs 10c, make sure you voted). Now you can get back here by doing /home at any point in time (it costs 1c). You have a total of 3 homes per world. Extra homes must be set with a name /sethome home2 or whatever name you like. List your homes with /listhomes. It is most comfortable to set different names in different worlds - and you can go between.
8.  Build your first home, set up your underground base, hit the wilderness, build in creative, play a minigame, or go on an adventure - it is up to you! Just remember you have up to 10 days to do something with the city plot (or it might return to the state due to inactivity). Once you have a build ready and have played a couple of weeks, you may ask an admin for approval and promotion to Journeyman.
9.  Read up on the many excellent plugins we have on the server. All carefully selected to help the game become less of a chore and more of a challenging, varied, fun and balanced building and adventure game. Use /help or just TAB-complete in chat if you need to find a command, or check out our: [Commands & Plugins Reference Guide](https://damnation.eu/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=591). Also have a look at our [Custom Recipes](https://damnation.eu/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=5780). Use /recipe [item] to get a visual guide for all recipes.

## Need Help?

We pride ourselves as being a friendly and welcoming community. If you need help with something, asking in global chat for help will likely lead to an admin or other community member answering your question or helping you out in another way. We love helping out new members take in the enormity that is our list of server features. Don't worry about asking a lot of questions in the beginning - we were all there, once!

However, don't beg for or pester admins unless it is actually called for. If an admin is active, they will either answer you or tell you to be patient if they are currently occupied. No freebies or gifts are granted. If you still need help and no admin is around use /modreq <message>. That files a request to the admins. Be detailed and use at the location of where the problem is as the admin will teleport to the exact location where you type the /modreq.</message>

## Need materials?

*   Dig on your own plot to your hearts content.
*   Use the public treefarms at /warp treefarm (all kinds of wood) or at /warp south (for pine). Remember to replant.
*   The market has a lot of materials for sale (including unobtainable items in the state store) /warp market, or if you're not in Homeland use /warp homeland market. shift+clicking the chest to get more info and if you want to buy then type the amount in chat after shift+clicking.
*   You can get as much sand as you need at the Sand farm at /warp sandfarm.
*   You can start some easy mining in the public mine at /warp publicmine. But you can certainly also set up your own mining operation in any of the many worlds' wildernesses.
*   Trade with other players.

## Need money?

*   Vote! It is by far the fastest and easiest way to earn cash. You can earn 200c by voting on each site every 24 hours.
*   Buy and sell stuff at the market
*   Play and win more than you lose at MobArena
*   Raid dungeons (hard, see below)
*   Help someone with a job for cash (or stuff)
*   Win or place well in a competition
*   Come with a particularly helpful suggestion or report a cheater
*   Visit maps that have "Tourist Awards" from easily visible chest such as Adamantis, Titanic and Mages College.
*   Finish a challenge maps on RCA like The Dropper or Downward

## Want to explore the server and look for treasure?

Excellent, because damNation is a server of many hidden things and secrets! You will find the very first Treasure Chest in the spawn info house (starter kit), but there are more nearby!

In fact, many similar chests containing treasure and/or money are hidden around the server and especially around central Spawn city (not in player houses), there are many hidden areas and treasure rewards for finding them. Most warp locations have a hidden chest as well. Do /tchest count to see your progress in finding secret chests (counted per world, but Homeland has the most and is the best start).

Some friendly hints: Scout the terrain around Spawn, look for Temple of The Gods starting with the maze opposite the Tree Farm. Why not visit the library or pay your respects at the graveyard...

## Multiverse

Try out our other worlds like the Nether, The End, Kaleida (rainforest), Hoth (frozen), Remini (custom), Panau (custom), Tremoria (amplified), or Creative? Head to /warp nexus to check out the multitude of worlds we have to offer. **Read more:** [Our Multiverse](/main/getting-started/multiverse-worlds)

## Bungee Servers

### CivCraft

We host a CivCraft PvP server, which combines elements of Civilization and Minecraft into a PvP mod! Check it out at /server civ. **Read more:**[CivCraft](/pvp/civcraft)

### Minigames and Adventure

If you want to play some minigames or complete adventure maps, head to /server rca to get your fill of Capture The Flag, MarioKart, Quake, Blockhunt, and much more! New plugins are added frequently and weâ€™re always accepting suggestions. **Read more:**[RagnaCraft Adventures](/rca)

## Want to go to the wilderness?

It is anywhere outside the city limit (seen on the dynmap blue area, or roughly where the monorail goes). But Homeland is very full already so there is also plenty of wilderness in the other Survival worlds, which you can access by portals at /warp nexus You may mine, dig and build anywhere in the wilderness in any world as long as the rules are followed and distance to other players are respected.

## Want to design/build something in Creative?

We have several Creative worlds available. But we suggest you start with a plot in the (newest) Creative Plotworld. Go there with /warp nexus3 and choose the Creative Plotworld portal. **Read more:**[Creative](/creative)

Once there, read the signs, spend your first 200c (which you got from voting properly) and get your first plot by typing /plotme auto and you will get a private and protected 100x100 creative plot! Teleport to your first plot with /plotme home. If you really wanna get building, get WorldEdit powers in your plot by making a small donation to the server (comes with many other benefits).

## Want a dungeon challenge?

There are a couple of gnarly multilevel dungeons available. You earn items and cash doing them. But beware, it is hard and requires good equipment. You are also forbidden to tp/warp while inside. Fight your way to the final double chest on the final level for a nice prize. Push the reset button there to return to surface and the dungeon is reset for the next challenger. You can find dungeons at:

*   Near /warp sandfarm
*   Near /warp north
*   In Foundland, quite close to spawn (and another "lost" dungeon somewhere)
*   In Panau, head forward up and into the mountains, there are some signs helping you find the way.
*   In Remini, there are several custom dungeons waiting that reset for each player every two weeks.

## Private Land or More Plots

Once you have played for a while, gathered some cash - you probably will want to protect a larger area in the wilderness and/or buy more city plots. **Read more:**[Land Ownership](/main/land-ownership)

## Stats and Info

*   We have fun and very extensive stats under [http://damnation.eu/stats/](/ http://damnation.eu/stats/) and [http://damnation.eu/oldstats/](http://damnation.eu/oldstats/)

## Want to Support the Server?

Contribute to the significant costs and development of the server by considering making a small donation.

The server is run completely on idealistic terms, and I am paying for the brunt of it out of my own personal pocket (didn't even have donations for the first 6 months of operation). All donated money will go to server running costs (we do have dedicated monster hardware in a datacenter) and/or improvements/advertising.

See the [Donations](/about-us/donations) for details.

Enjoy your eternal stay in damNation!
