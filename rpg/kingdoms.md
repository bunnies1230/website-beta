##Citizens
</div>

<p>There are four functional positions on the server - <b>Leader</b>, <b>Advisor</b>, <b>Citizen</b>, and <b>Peasant</b>. The first three are kingdom-only positions, while <b>Peasant</b> is reserved for those without a kingdom affiliation. Below are a list of features that each position has access to. Each higher position inherits the features of the previous position.</p>

TABLE OF GAMEPLAY FEATURES BY POSITION

<p>There can only be one leader at a time and every kingdom always must have a leader. If a  leader wants to step down, they must promote an advisor to take their place, which will cause the two players to switch positions. The new leader will inherit ownership of all claimed chunks. Leaders can change positions of any players within their kingdom.</p>

<p>Outside of the positions, leaders can grant cosmetic titles to any citizen of their empire including themself. This allows leaders to create internal hierarchies, specializations, and honorary titles to diversify their kingdom.</p>

<p>If a citizen is a member of a kingdom, they are not allowed to leave without giving their leader and the staff notice.</p>

##Governments
</div>

<p>Different forms of governments determine the basis of leadership changes and internal economy. Don't worry, there's no math required here, on your end. The leadership changes are used in the event that a leader is inactive, steps down, or the natural election cycle has come around. Internal economy information deals with how your money is used when you deposit it into your treasury. Depending on the government, a certain percentage of your deposit will be deposited, given to the leader, redistributed to your fellow citizens, and the rest is wasted. <b>Communism</b> and <b>Republic</b> increase your initial deposit and turn a profit. It costs a large sum to revolt to a different government, but you can choose any government at any time if you have the funds in your treasury. Reference the chart below for information about government differences. The money amounts are based on an initial deposit of <b>100 Rupees</b> in each government.</p>
