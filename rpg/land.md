##Land Ownership
</div>

<p>Kingdoms begin with a maximum of <b>16 chunks</b> that can be claimed. For every citizen that joins outside of the original founders, the kingdom can claim 4 more chunks. Only Leaders can claim and unclaim chunks. Claiming a chunk is a <b>50 Rupee investment</b> that can be returned if the chunk is later unclaimed. Chunks can only be claimed <b>within 128 blocks</b> of the kingdom's current /home location. This home location can be changed by Leaders or Advisors at a hefty cost of <b>1000 Rupees</b> if further expansion is wanted.</p>

<b>Chests are the only blocks that can be protected with /lock</b>
</p>

<p>Every chunk claimed is owned by the current leader and all members of the kingdom are added as members. If a new leader is promoted, they will inherit ownership of the kingdom's land. Monster spawning is denied. Chests are protected automatically upon placement like on Main. For chest management, consult our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/g/lwc">LWC Guide</a>. Though doors, furnaces, and other useable blocks cannot be locked, they cannot be opened, closed, or accessed by players who are not members of your land. All protected chunks are visible on the dynmap.</p>

<p>The server logs all block changes with CoreProtect. Only admins are able to rollback, restore, or lookup changes, so if you suspect foul play, please let an admin know with a <b>/modreq</b></p>

###Building
</div>
<p>Building is <b>aesthetic</b>, <b>manual</b>, and <b>optional</b>. There are no auto-generated or auto-building structures. We recommend building walls to keep out enemy players and monsters, but there are no real functional buildings to create. How you decide to build up your kingdom is entirely up to the kingdom's citizens.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/CraftBook/Usage">CraftBook mechanics</a> from Main can be constructed here by <b>any rank</b> - Doors, Gates, Elevators, Bridges, Hidden Switches, and Painting Switches. You can also construct <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/lift/">Lift elevators</a>.</p>
