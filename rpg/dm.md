##Dungeon Master and Events
</div>

<p>Some staff members will act as <b>Dungeon Masters (DM)</b>. If you haven't played a tabletop game before, a DM is "the game organizer and participant in charge of creating the details and challenges of a given adventure, while maintaining a realistic continuity of events." They will shape the world by creating unique events and challenges that will turn the server into an ever-changing landscape of challenges. These events can be <b>positive, neutral, negative, or any combination of the three</b>. They can add features, remove them, or cripple them. Most of the time, events that occur are there to stay unless a victory condition is given.</p>

<p>Though your claimed chunks protect you from invading players and monsters, <b>they WILL NOT protect you from events</b>. If a meteor crashes, your down may be spared, damaged, or even destroyed. However, <b>chests and only chests will be safe</b> - no event will destroy chests. However, other storage devices like furnaces, dispensers, etc are subject to destruction.</p>

<b>IMPORTANT: Nothing but chests are safe on this server. If a meteor comes and hits a town, buildings may be destroyed without compensation. Chests are the only things that will be spared.</b>
</p>

<p>For those who are curious about our DM process, here's an explanation. After we'll create an event, we determine the scale of best to worst possible outcomes, and <b>roll a virtual 20-sided die to determine what happens to each party</b>. In tabletop games, rolling a 1 or 20 are known as critical rolls, with a 1 being a critical failure and a 20 being a critical hit. Numbers closer to 20 are much more positive for the player, while those closer to 1 are very dangerous. In the event of either critical roll, the DM is allowed to <b>go off-scale and determine a more creative outcome</b>. For each event, at least one die will be rolled for each kingdom, but there may be more depending on the event to give more specific outcomes (i.e. a wall breach could result in 4 rolls - one for North, South, East, and West-facing walls).</p>

<p>For your own roleplay, players are able to use <b>/roll</b>, which will roll a 20D and broadcast the result to players within 100 blocks of you. These rolls are purely cosmetic and are used solely for creative roleplay.</p>

###Roll
</div>
<p>Leave fate to the 20D with <b>/roll</b>! If you want to play the game by luck and leave some decisions up to chance, use /roll to simulate a 20 sided die roll. The result will be broadcast to everyone in local chat range (100 blocks). <b>All rolls are logged</b>, so if there is ever a discrepancy in roll results, ask bunnies1230.
