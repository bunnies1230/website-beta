#RPG Gameplay
</div>

<hr>
<p>The server has been constructed with a variety of RPG features like kingdoms, classes, jobs, bosses, building, rare items, and exploration. Though we've tried to keep the gameplay simple, to ensure you get the most out of your experience, there are some features that you should know more about before diving into the server.</p>

##Getting Started
</div>

<p>When you first join, you'll be greeted by the message welcome you to the server and explaining the server's purpose. In each of the four directions are displays for each of the four kingdoms. Right clicking the <b>red bar</b> below each display shows you basic information about that kingdom. To join a kingdom, simply type <b>/kingdom join [kingdom name]</b> and you will be added!</p>

##Dungeon Master and Events
</div>

<p>Being an "RPG" server, roleplaying is the primary gameplay feature. While all players are encouraged to roleplay as their own characters, some staff members will act as <b>Dungeon Masters (DM)</b>. If you haven't played a tabletop game before, a DM is "the game organizer and participant in charge of creating the details and challenges of a given adventure, while maintaining a realistic continuity of events." They will shape the world by creating unique events and challenges that will turn the server into an ever-changing landscape of challenges. Much of the fun of this server will be interactions between the DMs and players who roleplay.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Kingdoms
</div>

<p>The gameplay of the server is balanced around being a member of a kingdom. Though it is not necessary to, we highly recommend joining a kingdom to take full advantage of the gameplay features. There are only four kingdoms in the world that can expand over time as more people join their ranks.</p>

<p>There are four functional positions on the server - <b>Leader</b>, <b>Advisor</b>, <b>Citizen</b>, and <b>Peasant</b>. The first three are kingdom-only positions, while <b>Peasant</b> is reserved for those without a kingdom affiliation.</p>

<p>Different forms of governments have benefits and downsides. As leaders and citizens, you can choose between a variety of governments to serve your economic, foreign policy, and roleplaying purposes.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Economy
</div>

<p>On the RPG server, the economy is completely separate from our main economy of Crowns. Here, the sought after currency is <b>Rupees</b>. The primary method of earning money is to join a job. <b>A player <i>DOES NOT</i> need be a part of a kingdom to join a job</b>. Jobs have been organized into a classes that have different major and minor skills. As you perform actions your class is skilled in, you will gain experience and rank up, earning progressively more XP and money. Money should primarily be spent on depositing into your kingdom's treasury, but it can also be used for travel expenses, buying materials or labor, or access to certain areas of the world.</p>

##Combat
</div>
<b></b>

<p>PvP is not the focus of the server, but engaging in it does have its perks. You cannot damage your fellow kingdom citizens, however, you can harm everyone else. As you kill players, your <b>infamy</b> will rise - as you are defeated, it will fall. Those with high infamy are much more profitable targets. Did someone rub you the wrong way? <b>Bounties</b> can be set on any player at any time which can be claimed by any player that is not allied to the target.</p>

<a name="land"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Land Ownership
</div>

<p>Kingdoms begin with a maximum of <b>16 chunks</b> that can be claimed. As citizens join a kingdom, leaders and advisors can claim more chunks. With different government forms, chunks can be claimed further away from the home location of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The server logs all block changes with CoreProtect. Only admins are able to rollback, restore, or lookup changes, so if you suspect foul play, please let an admin know with a <b>/modreq</b></p>

<p>Building is <b>aesthetic</b>, <b>manual</b>, and <b>optional</b>. There are no auto-generated or auto-building structures. How you decide to build up your kingdom is entirely up to the kingdom's citizens.</p>

<a name="world"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##World
</div>

<p>World are vanilla-custom generated to strike a balance between playability and more realistic terrain. Players can build anywhere in the wilderness. Only spawn, dungeons/other points of interest, and kingdom chunks are protected from building. Scope out the environment, scout your enemy's locations, and check out kingdom locations and land claims on the <a href="https://damnation.eu/rpgmap"><b>RPG Server Dynmap</b></a></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Travel
</div>
<p>Typical methods of travel from Main have been disabled, including /tpa, /sethome, and /back. The primary method of travel is by foot, by boat, by cart, or by horse. Members of kingdoms have access to /home, which for the cost of <b>100 Rupees</b> will teleport you directly to your kingdom's set spawnpoint.</p>

<p>Travel to spawn is slightly different than usual. The command will cost <b>50 Rupees</b> and has a <b>10 second warmup</b> before the teleport.</p>

<p>Points of interest around the world feature warps, however, you must travel and visit them once in order to warp there. <b>NOT AVAILABLE IN ALPHA</b> <i>More information to come...</i></p>
