#RPG Gameplay
</div>

<hr>
<p>The server has been constructed with a variety of RPG features like kingdoms, classes, jobs, bosses, building, rare items, and exploration. Though we've tried to keep the gameplay simple, to ensure you get the most out of your experience, there are some features that you should know more about before diving into the server.</p>

<hr>
<a name="getting-started"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Getting Started
</div>

<p>When you first join, you'll be greeted by the message welcome you to the server and explaining the server's purpose. In each of the four directions are displays for each of the four kingdoms. Right clicking the <b>red bar</b> below each display shows you basic information about that kingdom. To join a kingdom, simply type <b>/kingdom join [kingdom name]</b> and you will be added!</p>

##Dungeon Master and Events
</div>

<p>Some staff members will act as <b>Dungeon Masters (DM)</b>. If you haven't played a tabletop game before, a DM is "the game organizer and participant in charge of creating the details and challenges of a given adventure, while maintaining a realistic continuity of events." They will shape the world by creating unique events and challenges that will turn the server into an ever-changing landscape of challenges. These events can be <b>positive, neutral, negative, or any combination of the three</b>. They can add features, remove them, or cripple them. Most of the time, events that occur are there to stay unless a victory condition is given.</p>

<p>Though your claimed chunks protect you from invading players and monsters, <b>they WILL NOT protect you from events</b>. If a meteor crashes, your down may be spared, damaged, or even destroyed. However, <b>chests and only chests will be safe</b> - no event will destroy chests. However, other storage devices like furnaces, dispensers, etc are subject to destruction.</p>

<p style="border: 5px solid #77df88; text-align:center;border-radius:10px;background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;margin: 0px 70px 20px 70px;">
<b>IMPORTANT: Nothing but chests are safe on this server. If a meteor comes and hits a town, buildings may be destroyed without compensation. Chests are the only things that will be spared.</b>
</p>

<p>For those who are curious about our DM process, here's an explanation. After we'll create an event, we determine the scale of best to worst possible outcomes, and <b>roll a virtual 20-sided die to determine what happens to each party</b>. In tabletop games, rolling a 1 or 20 are known as critical rolls, with a 1 being a critical failure and a 20 being a critical hit. Numbers closer to 20 are much more positive for the player, while those closer to 1 are very dangerous. In the event of either critical roll, the DM is allowed to <b>go off-scale and determine a more creative outcome</b>. For each event, at least one die will be rolled for each kingdom, but there may be more depending on the event to give more specific outcomes (i.e. a wall breach could result in 4 rolls - one for North, South, East, and West-facing walls).</p>

<p>For your own roleplay, players are able to use <b>/roll</b>, which will roll a 20D and broadcast the result to players within 100 blocks of you. These rolls are purely cosmetic and are used solely for creative roleplay.</p>
<hr>
<a name="citizens"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Citizens
</div>

<p>There are four functional positions on the server - <b>Leader</b>, <b>Advisor</b>, <b>Citizen</b>, and <b>Peasant</b>. The first three are kingdom-only positions, while <b>Peasant</b> is reserved for those without a kingdom affiliation. Below are a list of features that each position has access to. Each higher position inherits the features of the previous position.</p>

TABLE OF GAMEPLAY FEATURES BY POSITION

<p>There can only be one leader at a time and every kingdom always must have a leader. If a  leader wants to step down, they must promote an advisor to take their place, which will cause the two players to switch positions. The new leader will inherit ownership of all claimed chunks. Leaders can change positions of any players within their kingdom.</p>

<p>Outside of the positions, leaders can grant cosmetic titles to any citizen of their empire including themself. This allows leaders to create internal hierarchies, specializations, and honorary titles to diversify their kingdom.</p>

<p>If a citizen is a member of a kingdom, they are not allowed to leave without giving their leader and the staff notice.</p>

<a name="governments"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Governments
</div>

<p>Different forms of governments determine the basis of leadership changes and internal economy. Don't worry, there's no math required here, on your end. The leadership changes are used in the event that a leader is inactive, steps down, or the natural election cycle has come around. Internal economy information deals with how your money is used when you deposit it into your treasury. Depending on the government, a certain percentage of your deposit will be deposited, given to the leader, redistributed to your fellow citizens, and the rest is wasted. <b>Communism</b> and <b>Republic</b> increase your initial deposit and turn a profit. It costs a large sum to revolt to a different government, but you can choose any government at any time if you have the funds in your treasury. Reference the chart below for information about government differences. The money amounts are based on an initial deposit of <b>100 Rupees</b> in each government.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Economy
</div>

<p>On the RPG server, the economy is completely separate from our main economy of Crowns. Here, the sought after currency is <b>Rupees</b>. Money is earned primarily through performing actions through your jobs. Money should primarily be spent on depositing into your kingdom's treasury, but it can also be used for travel expenses, buying materials or labor, or access to certain areas of the world. The commands remain the same as on main, which can be found in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/economy">Fe Guide</a></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Jobs
</div>
<p>The primary method of earning money is to join a job. <b>A player <i>DOES NOT</i> need be a part of a kingdom to join a job</b>. Jobs have been organized into a classes - <b>Werewolf</b>, <b>Orc</b>, <b>Elf</b>, <b>Dwarf</b>, and <b>Wizard</b>. Drawing from the lore of these races in classical fantasy, each class has different major and minor skills. As you perform actions your class is skilled in, you will gain experience and rank up, earning progressively more rewards for the same jobs. Major skills earn a class the maximum amount of money and experience. Minor skills earn a smaller percentage of the maximum money and experience. <b>Every class can do every gameplay action</b>. However, the actions that are not included as a skill will gain even less money than a minor skill and no experience toward your class.</p>
<p>Players can only be a worker in one job at a time. You may switch at any time, however, you will lose 10% (rounded up) of your gained levels upon leaving - at level 23, leaving a job will lose 3 levels. The maximum level for every job is 50. Once this maximum level is attained, you are free to switch to any other class without level loss in <b>that job only</b>. Leaving another job that is not at the max level will still result in level loss.</p>

<p>Below are the general skills for each class. Note that no XP is gained for classes by killing hostile mobs. To view specific information about which actions earn how much money and experience, look at the GUI accessed through <b>/jobs browse</b>.</p>

###Items
</div>
<p>Several new items have been introduced to the game as rare drops from boss monsters. <b>NOT AVAILABLE IN ALPHA</b> <i>More information to come...</i></p>

<hr>
<a name="pvp"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##PvP
</div>
<p>PvP is not the focus of the server, but engaging in it does have its perks. You cannot damage your fellow kingdom citizens, however, you can harm everyone else. Protected kingdom chunks protect any players from PvP. Spawn camping and spawn killing are expressly prohibited, but we have some preventative measures in place to give newly respawned players a short period of invincibilty.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Infamy
</div>
<p><b>Infamy</> is a unique game mechanic that determines how big of a target you are. All players begin on the server with 0 infamy. <p>If you kill another player, you gain infamy. You also are given a reward depending on the difference between your infamy level and your victim's. If you have a lower infamy level, you get a hefty reward in Rupees. Your infamy increases significatly as your victim's decreases significantly. However, if your victim has the same or lower infamy level, you don't gain much money and gain even more infamy, making you a bigger target.</p> 

<p>If you are killed by another player, you lose infamy. You'll become less of a target, but you'll also lose the same number of Rupees the player who killed you gained.</p>

<p>Use <b>/infamy</b> to view the different commands and options for this feature</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Bounties
</div>

<p><b>Bounties</b> can be set on any player at any time. The minimum amount that can be added is 100 Rupees. Each time you add some money to a player's head with <b>/bounty set [player] [amount]</b>, it will add it to that player's current bounty. The addition will be announced in-chat and on screen. When a player logs into the server with a bounty, all players will be given an on-screen message. Once a player is killed by another player, the killer claims the bounty and the player's bounty is removed. A bounty <b>will not</b> be removed if a player dies to a mob, kills themselves, or is killed by a fellow kingdom member - it MUST be at the hands of an enemy player.</p>

<p>Use <b>/bounty</b> to view the different commands and options for this feature</p>

<hr>
<a name="land-ownership"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Land Ownership
</div>

<p>Kingdoms begin with a maximum of <b>16 chunks</b> that can be claimed. For every citizen that joins outside of the original founders, the kingdom can claim 4 more chunks. Only Leaders can claim and unclaim chunks. Claiming a chunk is a <b>50 Rupee investment</b> that can be returned if the chunk is later unclaimed. Chunks can only be claimed <b>within 128 blocks</b> of the kingdom's current /home location. This home location can be changed by Leaders or Advisors at a hefty cost of <b>1000 Rupees</b> if further expansion is wanted.</p>

<p style="border: 5px solid #77df88; text-align:center;border-radius:10px;background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;margin: 0px 70px 20px 70px;">
<b>Chests are the only blocks that can be protected with /lock</b>
</p>

<p>Every chunk claimed is owned by the current leader and all members of the kingdom are added as members. If a new leader is promoted, they will inherit ownership of the kingdom's land. Monster spawning is denied. Chests are protected automatically upon placement like on Main. For chest management, consult our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/g/lwc">LWC Guide</a>. Though doors, furnaces, and other useable blocks cannot be locked, they cannot be opened, closed, or accessed by players who are not members of your land. All protected chunks are visible on the dynmap.</p>

<p>The server logs all block changes with CoreProtect. Only admins are able to rollback, restore, or lookup changes, so if you suspect foul play, please let an admin know with a <b>/modreq</b></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Building
</div>
<p>Building is <b>aesthetic</b>, <b>manual</b>, and <b>optional</b>. There are no auto-generated or auto-building structures. We recommend building walls to keep out enemy players and monsters, but there are no real functional buildings to create. How you decide to build up your kingdom is entirely up to the kingdom's citizens.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/CraftBook/Usage">CraftBook mechanics</a> from Main can be constructed here by <b>any rank</b> - Doors, Gates, Elevators, Bridges, Hidden Switches, and Painting Switches. You can also construct <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/lift/">Lift elevators</a>.</p>
<hr>
<a name="world"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##World
</div>

<p>World are vanilla-custom generated to strike a balance between playability and more realistic terrain. Players can build anywhere in the wilderness. Only spawn, dungeons/other points of interest, and kingdom chunks are protected from building. Scope out the environment, scout your enemy's locations, and check out kingdom locations and land claims on the <a href="https://damnation.eu/rpgmap"><b>RPG Server Dynmap</b></a></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Travel
</div>
<p>Typical methods of travel from Main have been disabled, including /tpa, /sethome, and /back. The primary method of travel is by foot, by boat, by cart, or by horse. Members of kingdoms have access to /home, which for the cost of <b>100 Rupees</b> will teleport you directly to your kingdom's set spawnpoint.</p>

<p>Travel to spawn is slightly different than usual. The command will cost <b>50 Rupees</b> and has a <b>10 second warmup</b> before the teleport.</p>

<p>Points of interest around the world feature warps, however, you must travel and visit them once in order to warp there. <b>NOT AVAILABLE IN ALPHA</b> <i>More information to come...</i></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Enemies
</div>
<p>Boss monsters will higher health, special abilities, and valuable drops have a change of spawning throughout the map. Others only spawn in specific areas. Normal monsters have higher health than their vanilla counterparts. <i>More information to come...</i></p>
