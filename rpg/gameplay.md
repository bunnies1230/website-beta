#RPG Gameplay
</div>

<hr>
<p>The server has been constructed with a variety of RPG features like kingdoms, classes, jobs, bosses, building, rare items, and exploration. Though we've tried to keep the gameplay simple, to ensure you get the most out of your experience, there are some features that you should know more about before diving into the server.</p>

<hr>
<a name="getting-started"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Getting Started
</div>

<p>When you first join, you'll be greeted by the message welcome you to the server and explaining the server's purpose. In each of the four directions are displays for each of the four kingdoms. Right clicking the <b>red bar</b> below each display shows you basic information about that kingdom. To join a kingdom, simply type <b>/kingdom join [kingdom name]</b> and you will be added!</p>

##Dungeon Master and Events
</div>

<p>Being an "RPG" server, roleplaying is the primary gameplay feature. While all players are encouraged to roleplay as their own characters, some staff members will act as <b>Dungeon Masters (DM)</b>. If you haven't played a tabletop game before, a DM is "the game organizer and participant in charge of creating the details and challenges of a given adventure, while maintaining a realistic continuity of events." They will shape the world by creating unique events and challenges that will turn the server into an ever-changing landscape of challenges. Much of the fun of this server will be interactions between the DMs and players who roleplay.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Kingdoms
</div>

<p>The gameplay of the server is balanced around being a member of a kingdom. Though it is not necessary to, we highly recommend joining a kingdom to take full advantage of the gameplay features. There are only four kingdoms in the world that can expand over time as more people join their ranks.</p>

<p>There are four functional positions on the server - <b>Leader</b>, <b>Advisor</b>, <b>Citizen</b>, and <b>Peasant</b>. The first three are kingdom-only positions, while <b>Peasant</b> is reserved for those without a kingdom affiliation.</p>

<p>Different forms of governments have benefits and downsides. As leaders and citizens, you can choose between a variety of governments to serve your economic, foreign policy, and roleplaying purposes.</p>

<a name="economy"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Economy
</div>

<p>On the RPG server, the economy is completely separate from our main economy of Crowns. Here, the sought after currency is <b>Rupees</b>. Money is earned primarily through performing actions through your jobs. Money should primarily be spent on depositing into your kingdom's treasury, but it can also be used for travel expenses, buying materials or labor, or access to certain areas of the world. The commands remain the same as on main, which can be found in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/economy">Fe Guide</a></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Jobs
</div>
<p>The primary method of earning money is to join a job. <b>A player <i>DOES NOT</i> need be a part of a kingdom to join a job</b>. Jobs have been organized into a classes - <b>Werewolf</b>, <b>Orc</b>, <b>Elf</b>, <b>Dwarf</b>, and <b>Wizard</b>. Drawing from the lore of these races in classical fantasy, each class has different major and minor skills. As you perform actions your class is skilled in, you will gain experience and rank up, earning progressively more rewards for the same jobs. Major skills earn a class the maximum amount of money and experience. Minor skills earn a smaller percentage of the maximum money and experience. <b>Every class can do every gameplay action</b>. However, the actions that are not included as a skill will gain even less money than a minor skill and no experience toward your class.</p>
<p>Players can only be a worker in one job at a time. You may switch at any time, however, you will lose 10% (rounded up) of your gained levels upon leaving - at level 23, leaving a job will lose 3 levels. The maximum level for every job is 50. Once this maximum level is attained, you are free to switch to any other class without level loss in <b>that job only</b>. Leaving another job that is not at the max level will still result in level loss.</p>

<p>Below are the general skills for each class. Note that no XP is gained for classes by killing hostile mobs. To view specific information about which actions earn how much money and experience, look at the GUI accessed through <b>/jobs browse</b>.</p>

###Items
</div>
<p>Several new items have been introduced to the game as rare drops from boss monsters. <b>NOT AVAILABLE IN ALPHA</b> <i>More information to come...</i></p>

<hr>
<a name="pvp"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##PvP
</div>
<p>PvP is not the focus of the server, but engaging in it does have its perks. You cannot damage your fellow kingdom citizens, however, you can harm everyone else. Protected kingdom chunks protect any players from PvP. Spawn camping and spawn killing are expressly prohibited, but we have some preventative measures in place to give newly respawned players a short period of invincibilty.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Infamy
</div>
<p><b>Infamy</> is a unique game mechanic that determines how big of a target you are. All players begin on the server with 0 infamy. <p>If you kill another player, you gain infamy. You also are given a reward depending on the difference between your infamy level and your victim's. If you have a lower infamy level, you get a hefty reward in Rupees. Your infamy increases significatly as your victim's decreases significantly. However, if your victim has the same or lower infamy level, you don't gain much money and gain even more infamy, making you a bigger target.</p> 

<p>If you are killed by another player, you lose infamy. You'll become less of a target, but you'll also lose the same number of Rupees the player who killed you gained.</p>

<p>Use <b>/infamy</b> to view the different commands and options for this feature</p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Bounties
</div>

<p><b>Bounties</b> can be set on any player at any time. The minimum amount that can be added is 100 Rupees. Each time you add some money to a player's head with <b>/bounty set [player] [amount]</b>, it will add it to that player's current bounty. The addition will be announced in-chat and on screen. When a player logs into the server with a bounty, all players will be given an on-screen message. Once a player is killed by another player, the killer claims the bounty and the player's bounty is removed. A bounty <b>will not</b> be removed if a player dies to a mob, kills themselves, or is killed by a fellow kingdom member - it MUST be at the hands of an enemy player.</p>

<p>Use <b>/bounty</b> to view the different commands and options for this feature</p>

<hr>
<a name="land-ownership"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##Land Ownership
</div>

<p>Kingdoms begin with a maximum of <b>16 chunks</b> that can be claimed. For every citizen that joins outside of the original founders, the kingdom can claim 4 more chunks. Only Leaders can claim and unclaim chunks. Claiming a chunk is a <b>50 Rupee investment</b> that can be returned if the chunk is later unclaimed. Chunks can only be claimed <b>within 128 blocks</b> of the kingdom's current /home location. This home location can be changed by Leaders or Advisors at a hefty cost of <b>1000 Rupees</b> if further expansion is wanted.</p>

<p style="border: 5px solid #77df88; text-align:center;border-radius:10px;background-color:#ffffff; padding: 10px;margin: 0px 70px 20px 70px;">
<b>Chests are the only blocks that can be protected with /lock</b>
</p>

<p>Every chunk claimed is owned by the current leader and all members of the kingdom are added as members. If a new leader is promoted, they will inherit ownership of the kingdom's land. Monster spawning is denied. Chests are protected automatically upon placement like on Main. For chest management, consult our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/g/lwc">LWC Guide</a>. Though doors, furnaces, and other useable blocks cannot be locked, they cannot be opened, closed, or accessed by players who are not members of your land. All protected chunks are visible on the dynmap.</p>

<p>The server logs all block changes with CoreProtect. Only admins are able to rollback, restore, or lookup changes, so if you suspect foul play, please let an admin know with a <b>/modreq</b></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Building
</div>
<p>Building is <b>aesthetic</b>, <b>manual</b>, and <b>optional</b>. There are no auto-generated or auto-building structures. We recommend building walls to keep out enemy players and monsters, but there are no real functional buildings to create. How you decide to build up your kingdom is entirely up to the kingdom's citizens.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.sk89q.com/wiki/CraftBook/Usage">CraftBook mechanics</a> from Main can be constructed here by <b>any rank</b> - Doors, Gates, Elevators, Bridges, Hidden Switches, and Painting Switches. You can also construct <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/lift/">Lift elevators</a>.</p>
<hr>
<a name="world"></a>
<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
##World
</div>

<p>World are vanilla-custom generated to strike a balance between playability and more realistic terrain. Players can build anywhere in the wilderness. Only spawn, dungeons/other points of interest, and kingdom chunks are protected from building. Scope out the environment, scout your enemy's locations, and check out kingdom locations and land claims on the <a href="https://damnation.eu/rpgmap"><b>RPG Server Dynmap</b></a></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Travel
</div>
<p>Typical methods of travel from Main have been disabled, including /tpa, /sethome, and /back. The primary method of travel is by foot, by boat, by cart, or by horse. Members of kingdoms have access to /home, which for the cost of <b>100 Rupees</b> will teleport you directly to your kingdom's set spawnpoint.</p>

<p>Travel to spawn is slightly different than usual. The command will cost <b>50 Rupees</b> and has a <b>10 second warmup</b> before the teleport.</p>

<p>Points of interest around the world feature warps, however, you must travel and visit them once in order to warp there. <b>NOT AVAILABLE IN ALPHA</b> <i>More information to come...</i></p>

<div style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">
###Enemies
</div>
<p>Boss monsters will higher health, special abilities, and valuable drops have a change of spawning throughout the map. Others only spawn in specific areas. Normal monsters have higher health than their vanilla counterparts. <i>More information to come...</i></p>
