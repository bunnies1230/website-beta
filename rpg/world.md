##World Information
</div>

<p>Worlds are vanilla-custom generated to strike a balance between playability and more realistic terrain. Players can build anywhere in the wilderness. Only spawn, dungeons/other points of interest, and kingdom chunks are protected from building. Scope out the environment, scout your enemy's locations, and check out kingdom locations and land claims on the <a href="https://damnation.eu/rpgmap"><b>RPG Server Dynmap</b></a></p>

##Travel
</div>
<p>Typical methods of travel from Main have been disabled, including /tpa, /sethome, and /back. The primary method of travel is by foot, by boat, by cart, or by horse. Members of kingdoms have access to /home, which for the cost of <b>100 Rupees</b> will teleport you directly to your kingdom's set spawnpoint.</p>

<p>Travel to spawn is slightly different than usual. The command will cost <b>50 Rupees</b> and has a <b>10 second warmup</b> before the teleport.</p>

<p>Points of interest around the world feature warps, however, you must travel and visit them once in order to warp there. <b>NOT AVAILABLE IN ALPHA</b> <i>More information to come...</i></p>
