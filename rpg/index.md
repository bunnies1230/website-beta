#RPG Server
</div>

<hr>
<p>Our RPG server combines elements from roleplaying video games and tabletop games to provide a unique RP experience. The server is open to all accepted members, regardless of rank. With four kingdoms in the world, citizens and leaders can choose to cooperate with others or seek to destroy. Our custom world is brimming with adventure and opportunity. You can choose your own class, build or lead a kingdom, and battle fearsome monsters! How you choose to play here is entirely up to you! Since this is a Roleplaying server, there will be DM (Dungeon Master) events where some change will happen to the world. Most of these changes will be permanent and some of them may destroy what you have created.</p>

<b>Fair Warning: Nothing but chests are safe on this server. If a meteor comes and hits a town, buildings may be destroyed without compensation. Chests are the only things that will be spared.</b>
</p>

<p>You can play casually and take advantage of the adventure <b>OR</b> you can take advantage of the roleplaying elements of leaders, citizens, governments, and competing kingdoms - that's the beauty of roleplaying! The purpose of this server is to create an interactive environment of friendly competition, where players can collaborate with or conspire against one another.</p>

<b>Interaction is the Key!</b>
</p>
<p>The server has been constructed with a variety of RPG features like kingdoms, classes, jobs, bosses, building, rare items, and exploration. Though we've tried to keep the gameplay simple, to ensure you get the most out of your experience, there is some information that you should know more about before diving into the server. <b>Click the buttons below for more information about rules, gameplay, and forum discussion</b>!</p>
