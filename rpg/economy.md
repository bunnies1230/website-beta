##Economy
</div>

<p>On the RPG server, the economy is completely separate from our main economy of Crowns. Here, the sought after currency is <b>Rupees</b>. Money is earned primarily through performing actions through your jobs. Money should primarily be spent on depositing into your kingdom's treasury, but it can also be used for travel expenses, buying materials or labor, or access to certain areas of the world. The commands remain the same as on main, which can be found in our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/economy">Fe Guide</a></p>

###Jobs
</div>
<p>The primary method of earning money is to join a job. <b>A player <i>DOES NOT</i> need be a part of a kingdom to join a job</b>. Jobs have been organized into a classes - <b>Werewolf</b>, <b>Orc</b>, <b>Elf</b>, <b>Dwarf</b>, and <b>Wizard</b>. Drawing from the lore of these races in classical fantasy, each class has different major and minor skills. As you perform actions your class is skilled in, you will gain experience and rank up, earning progressively more rewards for the same jobs. Major skills earn a class the maximum amount of money and experience. Minor skills earn a smaller percentage of the maximum money and experience. <b>Every class can do every gameplay action</b>. However, the actions that are not included as a skill will gain even less money than a minor skill and no experience toward your class.</p>
<p>Players can only be a worker in one job at a time. You may switch at any time, however, you will lose 10% (rounded up) of your gained levels upon leaving - at level 23, leaving a job will lose 3 levels. The maximum level for every job is 50. Once this maximum level is attained, you are free to switch to any other class without level loss in <b>that job only</b>. Leaving another job that is not at the max level will still result in level loss.</p>

<p>Below are the general skills for each class. Note that no XP is gained for classes by killing hostile mobs. To view specific information about which actions earn how much money and experience, look at the GUI accessed through <b>/jobs browse</b>.</p>
