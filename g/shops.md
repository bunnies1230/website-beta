#BetterShops

**BetterShops** is the server's shop plugin that replaced the deprecated SignShop plugin. It allows players to create a shop selling nearly 100 different kinds of items in one shop, accessible through an intuitive and attractive GUI.

Please note that if some of the tooltips go off of your screen, adjust your GUI size to smaller in your video settings.

##Notices
</div>
Since BetterShops is still a developing plugin, it has its issues. We will list any issues we encounter on the [BetterShops Notices](https://damnation.eu/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=7766) forum thread. By using the market as a vendor or consumer, you agree that you are up to date with this thread and that compensation will not be facilitated by staff members to resolve issues that have already been noted. However, we do suggest that you attempt to resolve the issue between players, if it is deemed necessary.

##Using a Shop
</div>

To browse someone's shop, right click their shop sign. From here, you can use the GUI's buttons to navigate the shop, search for items, and purchase or sell them.

  <tr>
    <th class="tg-yw4l" width="20%">Item</th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l" width="80%">Uses</th>

    <td class="tg-jogk"><b>Left-click</b> toggles between the shop's "buying" and "selling" windows. When the sign's name is "Buying," you are in the window where you can buy their stock, and vice-versa.</td>

    <td class="tg-jogk"><b>Left-click</b> opens your Cart. You can add many items to your cart while browsing to buy them all at once, rather than exiting the menu after purchasing each item individually.</td>

##Creating A Shop
</div>

If you choose to buy a shoplot, you can have your own shop. Each player is only able to own one shop at a time. You may create this shop anywhere on their shoplot after an admin has added the appropriate flag to the shoplot region. From there, you place a chest with a sign on the front of the chest. Type **[shop]** on the first line, and you will be prompted to name your shop.

##Managing your shop
</div>
Once you own a shop, you can access it through the GUI that appears when you right click the shop sign. 

You may add other players to your shop as **shopkeepers**, who are able to restock your existing shop supplies, but are not allowed to change prices or remove items. You may add or remove shopkeepers via the head icon next to the enderchest.

When adding items to your shop, the default price is **100c**. This relatively high default price, rather than a low default, is a safeguard to prevent valuable items from being bought at low prices if the shop owner forgets to set its price.

When adding items to your "Buying" inventory, **Asking Amount** refers to the amount of items the person would buy in one transaction for the price given. By default, asking amount is 1. Say, if you wanted to buy cobble by the stack at 1 crown per cobble, you could make the asking amount '64' and the price '64'. Unless you have been sold items, **DO NOT** attempt to collect **Stock**. This will put your stock into the negatives and you will lose out on the items people have sold to you.

Once you add an item to your shop, you may add all other matching items of that type in your inventory by left-clicking them.
