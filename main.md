##Server History
</div>

damNation was founded in November 2011 by OriginalMadman and has since produced and hosted over a hundred playable or explorable survival and creative worlds built by a vibrant community. The multiverse holds diverse maps ranging from Hoth, a cold, barren ice-world, to the amazing rainforest world of Kaleida and the vibrant forest and player collaboration-filled world of Hammerfell. The server has run several FTB and other modded Minecraft servers, hosting a variety of modpacks. In that time, Faua has also risen through the ranks to Maestro and has been integral on the technical side of server operations. The final member of the (un)holy trininty of Maestros was MAKroy, the owner of RagnaCraft, who after years of tireless service to the community, retired from admin duties. Several months later, bunnies1230 was promoted to Maestro to re-complete the trinity.

In March 2013, damNation merged with RagnaCraft, a PvP and Towny server owned by MAKroy, inheriting their main world, RagnaCraft Adventures, several staff members, and many new players. At this point, these two strong communities combined to form the NetherEndingStory. Since then, PvP servers have been an important and unique aspect in the community, hosting short term events like large-scale wars and Ultra Hardcore tournaments, as well as long-term features such as nation wars and CivCraft. RagnaCraft Adventures has also expanded and improved to include a variety of minigames and adventure maps.

damNation aims to be the last and best Minecraft community you will ever need! Our variety of features provide hours, days, and months of entertainment for everyone! We also listen to every suggestion from our community to make damNation truly a community built server. Our members hail from all corners of the globe and are active on the server at any time of day.
