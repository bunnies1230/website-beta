#Things To Do and See

damNation has a lot to offer. Years of development have produced some stunning builds and features. Though the list may change over time, we've worked hard to make sure that there's something for everyone, whether they're a builder, a fighter, an explorer, or anything in between!

## Want to go out in the wilderness?
</div>

It is anywhere outside the city limit (seen on the dynmap blue area, or roughly where the monorail goes). But Homeland is very full already so there is also plenty of wilderness in the other Survival worlds, which you can access by portals at /warp nexus You may mine, dig and build anywhere in the wilderness in any world as long as the rules are followed and distance to other players are respected.

## Want to explore the server and look for treasure?
</div>

Excellent, because damNation is a server of many hidden things and secrets! You will find the very first Treasure Chest in the spawn info house (starter kit), but there are more nearby!

In fact, many similar chests containing treasure and/or money are hidden around the server and especially around central Spawn city (not in player houses), there are many hidden areas and treasure rewards for finding them. Most warp locations have a hidden chest as well. Do **/tchest count** to see your progress in finding secret chests (counted per world, but Homeland has by far the most and is the best place to start).

Some friendly hints: Scout the terrain around Spawn, look for Temple of The Gods starting with the maze opposite the Tree Farm. Why not visit the library or pay your respects at the graveyard...

## Want private and protected land?
</div>

Once you have played for a while, gathered some cash - you probably will want to protect a larger area in the wilderness and/or buy more city plots. **Read more:** [Land Ownership]({{site.baseurl}}/land-ownership)

## Want a dungeon challenge?
</div>

There are a couple of gnarly multilevel dungeons available on **Main**. You earn items and cash doing them. But beware, it get much harder as you go. We highly suggest enchanted iron gear, enchanted weapons, and splash potions. **You are also forbidden to tp/warp while inside.** Take note of the mossy cobblestone - trying to mine walls adjacent to it will open secret passages to allow you to continue your adventure! Fight your way to the final double chest on the final level for a nice prize. Make sure to press the reset button there to return to surface and the dungeon is reset for the next challenger. You can find dungeons at:

*   Near /warp sandfarm
*   Near /warp north
*   In [Foundland]({{site.baseurl}}/foundland), quite close to spawn (and another "lost" dungeon somewhere)
*   In [Panau]({{site.baseurl}}/panau), head forward up and into the mountains, there are some signs helping you find the way.
*   In [Remini]({{site.baseurl}}/remini), there are several custom dungeons waiting that reset for each player every two weeks.

## Want to build something in Creative?
</div>

We have several Creative worlds available. As a tourist, you start out with access to [Plotworld]({{site.baseurl}}/plotworld). Visit there with **/server creative** and choose the button warp for Plotworld. 

Once there, read the signs, spend your first 200c (which you can get from one day of voting) and get your first plot by typing **/plotme auto** and you will get a private and protected 100x100 creative plot! Teleport to your first plot with **/plotme home**. Once you rank up to [Siren]({{site.baseurl}}/ranks), you can really get building by applying for WorldEdit powers in your plot.

## Bungee Servers
</div>

**Main** (/server main) is the server you will likely spend the most time on. It hosts the bulk of what damNation has to offer, with so many features that even veterans haven't explored them all!

**Creative** (/server creative) features a [variety of worlds]({{site.baseurl}}/creative-worlds) to fit any creative need, be it a small plot or a large collaborative world!

**Minigames** (/server minigames) is an ever-expanding server that features mainstay attractions such as **Survival Games** and **The Dropper**, as well as heavier combat in **Capture The Flag**. The list of features is always changing, so [read more here about our current game roster]({{site.baseurl}}/mg-features)!

**Abaddon** (/server creative) is a hardcore survival gamemode that involves sprinting and tunneling through a ruined world filled with deadly monsters and priceless treasure. This is a custom gamemode made for damNation inspired by a previous feature called Gehenna. [Read more about Abaddon here]({{site.baseurl}}/ab-gameplay).

**Hub** (/server hub) is the server you first logged into! It's a simple starting area with portals to each of our active servers for easy access.
